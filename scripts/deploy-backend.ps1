.SYNOPSIS
Deploy Backend to Railway - DIY Humanoid Configurator

.DESCRIPTION
Automated deployment script for the backend to Railway with comprehensive checks and error handling.

.PARAMETER Environment
Target environment (staging, production). Default: production

.PARAMETER SkipMigration
Skip database migration before deployment. Default: false

.PARAMETER SkipTests
Skip test execution before deployment. Default: false

.PARAMETER Force
Force deployment even if health checks fail. Default: false

.EXAMPLE
.\deploy-backend.ps1
Deploy to production with all checks

.EXAMPLE
.\deploy-backend.ps1 -Environment staging -SkipMigration
Deploy to staging without running database migration
